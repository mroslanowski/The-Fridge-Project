# The Fridge Project
## About the project
This web application allows users to search for culinary recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. After entering a list of ingredients, users can submit the query, and the application will return a list of recipes that include those ingredients. The retrieved recipes are presented in an attractive and readable format, complete with the recipe name, image, and a link to the full recipe. Additionally, the user interface is responsive, meaning the application looks and works well on both mobile and desktop devices.
